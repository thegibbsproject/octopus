OCTOPUS is a useful tool for chemical engineers, chemists, physicists and others scientific professionals. Its simplicity of use makes it a powerful tool for estimating various physical and chemical properties of organic molecular compounds. The following properties are covered in the latest version of OCTOPUS.

- density of liquids
- viscosity of gases
- viscosity of liquids
- thermal conductivity of gases
- thermal conductivity of liquids
- heat capacity of ideal gases
- heat of capacity of liquids
- normal melting point
- normal boiling point
- critical temperature
- critical pressure
- critical volume
- acentric factor
- surface tension
- standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K
- standard Gibbs energy of formation at 298 K
- enthalpy of fusion
- enthalpy of vaporization
- entropy of vaporization at normal boiling point
- vapor pressure
