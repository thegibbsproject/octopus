OCTOPUS is a library of Excel® functions developed to help students, researchers and engineers in the estimation of physical and chemical properties of pure organic molecular compounds. It is provided as an add-in and contains 215 functions (related to 154 estimation methods) that can be directly accessed in the spreadsheet environment. In general, the implemented methods are based either on the Corresponding States Principle or the Group Contribution concept. The following propertiesare covered in the present version:

- density of liquids
- viscosity of gases
- viscosity of liquids
- thermal conductivity of gases
- thermal conductivity of liquids
- heat capacity of ideal gases
- heat of capacity of liquids
- normal melting point
- normal boiling point
- critical temperature
- critical pressure
- critical volume
- acentric factor
- surface tension
- standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K
- standard Gibbs energy of formation at 298 K
- enthalpy of fusion
- enthalpy of vaporization
- entropy of vaporization at normal boiling point
- vapor pressure
- van der Waals volume
