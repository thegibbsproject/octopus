OCTOPUS is a powerful tool for chemical engineers, chemists, physicists and others scientific professionals. It's also useful for learn about predictive methods for various physical and chemical properties of organic molecular compounds. Especially for methods based on the Principle of Corresponding States and the Group Contribution concept. The following properties can be estimated by OCTOPUS:

- density of liquids
- viscosity of gases
- viscosity of liquids
- thermal conductivity of gases
- thermal conductivity of liquids
- heat capacity of ideal gases
- heat of capacity of liquids
- normal melting point
- normal boiling point
- critical temperature
- critical pressure
- critical volume
- surface tension
- standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K
- standard Gibbs energy of formation at 298 K
- enthalpy of fusion
- enthalpy of vaporization
- entropy of vaporization at normal boiling point
- vapor pressure
- van der Waals volume
